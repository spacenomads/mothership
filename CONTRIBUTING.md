Thank you for considering contributing to **Asteroids**!

Asteroids is a web starter kit that generates static sites using SCSS and a super cool Javascript template language called [Nunjucks]().

If you give it a go and/or find something that is missing you can contribute to the project by:

- Report an [issue/bug](https://github.com/spacenomads/Asteroids/issues/new?assignees=oneeyedman&labels=bug&template=---bug-report.md&title=)
- Request a [feature](https://github.com/spacenomads/Asteroids/issues/new?assignees=oneeyedman&labels=%F0%9F%92%A1+New%21&template=---feature-request.md&title=)

As you can see it is no big deal to help out and I will list you as a contributor on my "Heart List." ;)
